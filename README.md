## Fast React Pizza Web App 2

### Version 2 - Feature Enhancements

In this repository, you are viewing the enhanced version of the Fast Pizza App (Fast Pizza App 2.0). The enhanced version introduces a range of new features and improvements, enhancing the user experience and project functionality.

#### Feature Highlights

1. **Ingredient Customization**: Users can now customize their pizza orders by adding or removing specific ingredients. This feature provides a more personalized ordering experience.

2. **Order Editing**: Once an order is placed, users have a window of five minutes to make modifications. To ensure the security of orders, users are required to create a unique PIN for each order. After the initial five-minute period, orders can no longer be edited.

3. **Priority Orders**: Users can set orders as "priority," which adds a unique status to their orders and recalculates the price. This functionality required solving some challenges when transitioning to Supabase.

4. **Data State Persistence**: The project now leverages Redux Persist to save and restore user data, including their cart items and logged-in state. This ensures a seamless and consistent experience for returning users.

5. **Logout Functionality**: A logout feature has been added, allowing users to securely log out and clear their cart, ensuring the protection of user data and privacy.

The enhanced version (Fast Pizza App 2.0) builds upon the core concepts covered in the initial course project and incorporates these features to provide an improved and more feature-rich pizza ordering experience.
